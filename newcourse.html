                    (e.g., heavy duty applications), with an emphasis on retrofitting. In addition, 
                    the limitations (as a result of hydrogen's unique features) will be highlighted as well 
                    as some of the challenges that are currently subjects of ongoing research.

                Chris obtained a Mmath and Ph.D. in mathematics in 2008 and 2012, respectively, 
                both from the University of Bath. Between 2012 and 2015, he was the postdoctoral 
                researcher on the EPSRC project EP/I019456/1 at the University of Exeter. He obtained the award of FHEA in 2018. 
                Chris's research interests lie at the intersection of mathematical analysis and mathematical control theory. 
                In its broadest sense, mathematical control theory seeks to both understand and consequently shape the behaviour of 
                interconnected dynamical systems — modelling temporally-varying real-world objects. Chris is also interested in 
                establishing connections between mathematical control theory, and problems arising in biology and ecology, 
                and seeks to increase the awareness and uptake of concepts from mathematical systems and control theory in ecological modelling and management. 
                The concepts of forced nonlinear dynamics, feedbacks, and control or management strategies/actions are ubiquitous in both disciplines.
                His research draws upon and contributes to techniques from a range of mathematical areas, including: dynamical systems theory;
                 evolution equations; positive (ordered) systems, and; real, complex and applied functional analysis.

                He has obtained a PhD in Mechanical Engineering in 2018 from Northumbria University at Newcastle based on his research into novel numerical methods applied to modelling of machining composite materials.
                Dr Kahwash's research interests are varied (renewable technologies, energy storage, aerodynamics, materials and manufacturing) 
                with common denominator of physics-based modelling/numerical methods. Prior to joining Napier University in 2021, 
                he worked as research assistant then research fellow at Northumbria University, 
                where he was involved in several EU funded projects related to renewable energy teaching (Erasmus+) and research (Horizon 2020).

                She completed her thesis on the optimisation of polymer coated long period grating-based sensors for structural health monitoring applications, in 2013. 
                Lourdes has significant industrial experience, having worked within the R&D section of Alcatel-Lucent Ltd. for over 7 years, a company specialising in design, 
                implementation, build and test of optical fibre telecommunications products. The work at Alcatel-Lucent has given her valuable industrial experience through which 
                she gained both practical and industry focused approach, especially in the field of optical fibre technology. Since joining Edinburgh Napier in 2013, she has been
                actively conducting her research career within the highly topical field of optical fibre sensors. She had been working on a range of projects from civil engineering 
                to biomedical engineering applications where state-of-the-art sensors are utilised.
